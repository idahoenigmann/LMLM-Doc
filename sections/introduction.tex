\section{Goal}
The goal of this diploma thesis is to show the possibilities and advantages of using machine learning for localization, and to provide an API for easy use by future robotics students. In order to do localization a neural network will evaluate two images with different points of view. From these two points of view it will return the relative distance from the point of view of the second image to any given object visible in both images. Machine Learning will be used in order to not be dependent on a specific situation or setup. The localization should hereby work on, for example, objects varying in size and/or in different situations of lighting.
