Robots are getting more and more mobile. While a few years ago their usage was mostly limited to aid factory automation, robots have found widespread adoption in a multitude of industries, such as self driving cars and autonomous delivery drones.
A challenge frequently encountered is navigating in unknown environments, which either requires the robot to sense specific characteristics of its surroundings or to communicate with some external system.

The problem of navigation has been looked at from many different angles. One popular approach in mobile robotics is to use GPS, an external positioning system. In order to determine the position of a robot using GPS it has to establish communication with at least four satellites. The exact position of each satellite as well as the current time is broadcasted by the satellites. By measuring the time needed for the signal to reach the robot the position can be calculated up to three meters accuracy.
However, in some cases positioning a robot using external positioning methods is no possible. In the case of GPS this can be due to obstacles interfering with the radio signals send by the satellites.
In comparison, we focus on a system that can navigate outdoor as well as indoor. 

\section{Goal}
The goal of this diploma thesis is to implement a system which can localize a robot using no other sensors than a camera. We not only want to implement an easy to use API for future robotic students, but to also show the possibilities and advantages of using machine learning for this challenge.

[alles todo]
In order to accomplish this localization, a neural network will evaluate two images with different points of view. From these two points of view it will return the relative distance from the point of view of the second image to any given object visible in both images. Machine Learning will be used in order to not be dependent on a specific situation or setup. The localization should hereby work on, for example, objects varying in size and/or in different situations of lighting.
