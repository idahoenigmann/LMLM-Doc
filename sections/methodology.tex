\section{Neural Network}
The authors decided to use a software framework called TensorFlow for the first implementation of the neural network. This has the following two advantages: using Tensorflow allows for a low effort proof of concept and it makes testing out different configurations (e.g. number of hidden layers or filters in image preprocessing) of the neural network easier.

After it has been shown that the challenge of detecting the distance to an object can be solved using machine learning, the authors plan on implementing a neural network in C++ on their own. The knowledge gained in the TensorFlow implementation will be used in the C++ implementation, which hopefully will make the work less time consuming.

\section{TensorFlow}
As machine learning has gained popularity in recent years the demand for applicable frameworks grew. One of the most popular is called TensorFlow. It was developed by Google for internal use and was published under the Apache License 2.0 on the \nth{9} of November 2015.

TensorFlow supports APIs for Python, C, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript and Swift.
Due to its popularity third party APIs for C\#, R, Scala, Rust and many more were developed.

Its use cases reach from categorizing handwritten digits to YouTube video recommendations, one of the many applications Google use it for.

Tom Hope et al. describe TensorFlow as a software framework for numerical computations based on dataflow graphs \footcite[page 6]{Hope_Learning_TensorFlow}.

\subsection{Computation graph}
To compute a value using TensorFlow a computation graph has to be constructed. In this graph each node corresponds to an operation, such as subtraction or division. By connecting these nodes via edges the output of one node can be fed as input into another node. One example of such a computation graph can be seen in Figure~\ref{pic:implementation_tensorflow_nodesAndGraphs_computationGraph}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{img/implementation_tensorflow_nodesAndGraphs_computationGraph.png}
	\caption{Each node represents an operation, where $const$ stands for a constant value, $add$ for addition, $mul$ for multiplication and $div$ for division. Edges, represented by arrows, connect nodes. The information shared between the nodes is described by the numbers written next to the edges. This computational graph calculates the result of the arithmetic expression $(28 * 2) + 28 / 2$.}
	\label{pic:implementation_tensorflow_nodesAndGraphs_computationGraph}
\end{figure}

The implementation of the computation graph, shown in Figure~\ref{pic:implementation_tensorflow_nodesAndGraphs_computationGraph}, in Python could look as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(28)
b = tf.constant(2)

c = tf.multiply(a, b)
d = tf.add(a, c)
e = tf.divide(d, b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
out = sess.run(e)

print(out)
\end{lstlisting}

The first line specifies that the TensorFlow functionality should be imported. Line 3 and 4 define the two constant values and assigns them the values 28 and 2 respectively. In line 6 to 8 the other nodes of the graph are specified. E.g. in line 6 a new node, named $c$, is created and the output of node $a$ and node $b$ are connected as its input. To perform the calculation described by the graph a new session is created in line 10. Finally the output of the graph (node $e$) is specified in line 11, the result is calculated and printed in line 13.

TensorFlow allows for another way of specifying a graph with these arithmetic operations:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(28)
b = tf.constant(2)

e = (a * b + a) / b

with tf.Session() as sess:
out = sess.run(e)

print(out)
\end{lstlisting}

This code is equivalent to the first one, but uses syntactic sugar to shorten line 6 to 8 in the first code block into line 6. At this point it should be noted that while it might look like it line 6 does not calculate anything. It simply describes how the computational graph should look. The answer (42) is calculated in the session in line 9.

\subsection{Alternatives to Tensorflow}
[INFO: Abstraction libraries such as Keras and TF-Slim offer simplified  high-level  access  to  the  "LEGO  bricks"  in  the  lower-level  library,  helping  to streamline the construction of the dataflow graphs, training them, and running inference. \footcite[page 7]{Hope_Learning_TensorFlow}]

\section{Generating data}
Neural Networks require huge amounts of data to work reliably. Because of the author's limited time frame this test data will be generated with the help of Blender 2.8. Blender is a free program for designing and animating 3D objects, which also supports scripting with python to add or remove objects from a scene. The authors will use this capability to generate the huge amounts of test data needed from the perspectives of the 2 cameras, which point to a specific object in the scene. This enables the authors to use and train a neural network, since shooting the amount of pictures needed by hand would take too long to consider this idea.

\subsection{Blender}
Besides 3D-modelling Blender enables the user to perform various different actions, such as laying out scenes, UV-Editing, shading, animating and rendering. Additionally scenes can be modified by executing Python scripts. Figure~\ref{pic:methodology_generatingData_blender_startscreen} shows the interface of Blender 2.8 with the default file loaded.

The authors decided to extensively use the scripting function in their work. One example of a Python script, that can be executed in blender is the following code:
