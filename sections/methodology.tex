schwarz-weiß?
auflösung?
filter?
object detection?

[TODO: Funktionsweise]

\section{Generating data}
[blender]
Neural Networks require huge amounts of data to work reliably. Because of the author's limited time frame this test data will be generated with the help of Blender 2.8. Blender is a free program for designing and animating 3D objects, which also supports scripting with python to add or remove objects from a scene. The authors will use this capability to generate the huge amounts of test data needed from the perspectives of the 2 cameras, which point to a specific object in the scene. This enables the authors to use and train a neural network, since shooting the amount of pictures needed by hand would take too long to consider this idea.
