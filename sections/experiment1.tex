The first experiment tests whether the trained neural network from Section~\ref{sec:implementation_neural_network} generalises to other objects. Since it is impossible to train the neural network for all existing objects, this experiment tests if the neural network can, by learning from one object, determine the distance to other objects as well.

\section{Setup}
The addition of the third convolutional layer (see Fig.~\ref{pic:implementation_neuralNetwork_modificationsToTheNN_model}) allowed to solve problems of a higher complexity, as compared to before. For this experiment the neural network was further developed to attain a colour image as an input and output the corresponding x-, y- and z-coordinate. These changes dramatically increased the number of parameters and therefore the need for RAM and computation power. [TODO: specs beschreiben @Peter]

\section{Sequence of Events}
To train the neural network, the authors chose the monkey head object, as depicted in Figure~\ref{pic:implementation_generatingData_testObject}. This neural network is trained exclusively on the monkey head until the mean error is confirmed to be less than 10\%. For training the authors use 500 distinct images each for monkey heads of 5 different sizes, totalling in 2500 images.

After the neural network has been trained and reached a respectable accuracy, the authors will then test the neural network with images of another object. This object can again be seen in Figure~\ref{pic:implementation_generatingData_testObject}. Again, 500 distinct images for each of the 5 sizes are used. First the training aspect (changing the weights of the neural network according to the new input) will be disabled, allowing the authors to figure out the accuracy of the neural network when viewing new images for the first time.

Then the training aspect will be enabled again and the time and effort needed to reach an accuracy of under 10\% when training both objects will be measured.
